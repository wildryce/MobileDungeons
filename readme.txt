V.0.1 Push Update Notes

CREATECHARACTER.LUA
- Updated how the textbox handles newlines or pressing enter.

INN.LUA
- Balanced the cost to heal/revive at the inn.

INVENTORY.LUA
- Added update() function to handle saving variable updates and doText() function to handle item list updates.

LEVELUP.LUA
- Fixed a possible timer issue that existed on certain levelups.
- Player should no longer get instantly sent to the dungeon screen on levelup anymore.

MAIN.LUA
- Fixed issue with safeguard. Now variables should properly get checked and saved if an issue is found.

SHOP.LUA
- Updated prices to balance the game some more. Although itis harder to gain zoulds, some prices have gone up (selling some down) as before it was quite easy to get whatever with little work. This should hopefully make the game the little bit more leaned on the work-for-it side.
